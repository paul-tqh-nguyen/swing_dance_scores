# swing_dance_scores

This is a web interface for performing relative placement, a common scoring mechanism used in [Swing Dancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(dance)) competitions.

Please also see our [wiki](https://github.com/paul-tqh-nguyen/swing_dance_scores/wiki) for additional information.

We have a [brief explanation of relative placement on our wiki](https://github.com/paul-tqh-nguyen/swing_dance_scores/wiki/Relative-Placement-Explanation). 

For further explanation on how relative placement works, see [some of the external resources on the topic that we found insightful](https://github.com/paul-tqh-nguyen/swing_dance_scores/wiki/Useful-External-Resources).

## Architecture

This repository provides functionality for a front-facing interface that'll perform relative scoring.

The front end and scoring mechanisms are implemented in [React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(web_framework)) & [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).

Our serverside fucntionality for storing and updating results utilizes [Firebase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebase).
